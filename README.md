# BazaarSteamWrapper

## About
**BazaarWrapper** is a lightweight wrapper designed to integrate The Bazaar game with Steam as a non-Steam game. By using this wrapper, you can unlock access to Steam features such as game recording, the Steam overlay, and more.

## Why BazaarWrapper Exists
Directly adding the Tempo Launcher to Steam as a non-Steam game doesn't work effectively—the Steam platform fails to recognize The Bazaar's game process. Furthermore, adding The Bazaar's game process itself to Steam isn't feasible due to the need for specific launch parameters from the Tempo Launcher.

## How BazaarWrapper Works
BazaarWrapper is a simple yet powerful tool that:
- Launches the Tempo Launcher.
- Detects The Bazaar's game process and retrieves its start parameters (requiring administrator privileges).
- Re-launches the game under BazaarWrapper's process, seamlessly enabling Steam integration.

## Setup Instructions
To use BazaarWrapper, follow these steps:
1. Add the `BazaarWrapper.exe` file to Steam as a non-Steam game.
2. Configure the launch options by setting the path to the Tempo Launcher.

Please note:
- Customizations, such as banners or logos, are not provided. You can source these separately to personalize your Steam interface.

## Important Information
BazaarWrapper is an independent open source project and is not affiliated with Tempo or Steam.
